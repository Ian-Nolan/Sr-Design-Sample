# Sr-Design-Sample

After wrapping up the unit using the Atmel ARM Cortex-M4, we began a final project using a Raspberry Pi. My team decided to build a real-time karaoke machine that could also playback uploaded .mp3 media. I was responsible for implementing the user-interface through a locally-hosted web server. This was a super fun project and I'm glad you're here!
